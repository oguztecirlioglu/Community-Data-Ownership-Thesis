## READ BEFORE RUNNING

This project is written in JavaScript, and needs certain JavaScript modules (dependencies) to be installed before the server can be brought up.

To do this, in the root directory of this project (`cd ./local-gateway`), run `npm install`. This will install the dependencies.

Then, to bring up the local gateway server, run `node localGateway.js`
